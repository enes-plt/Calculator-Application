# Calculator Application

Calculator Application via Java


This Java project creates a basic calculator application using Swing for the graphical interface. It defines a Calculator class implementing ActionListener.
The calculator includes buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, decimal point, equals, delete, clear, and negation.
The ActionListener manages button clicks to perform corresponding actions such as concatenating numbers, handling arithmetic operations, calculating results, and managing text field input.
The main method initializes and runs the calculator application.
